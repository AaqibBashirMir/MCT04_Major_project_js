<h2> About the project </h2>

Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game played on a grid of cells. The objective is to uncover all cells that do not contain hidden mines. Mines are randomly placed on the grid, and each uncovered cell displays a number indicating the count of adjacent mines. Players can flag cells they suspect contain mines. The game ends if a mine is uncovered, and success is achieved by revealing all safe cells. With varying grid sizes and difficulty levels, Minesweeper challenges players to use logic and deduction to navigate the minefield successfully.

<h2> Key Features </h2>

1. Responsive Design: The game adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent and enjoyable experience for players.
2. Difficulty Levels: Three levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) cater to players with varying skill levels, adjusting the grid size and mine density accordingly.
3. Attractive UI: A visually appealing user interface enhances the gaming experience, making it more engaging and enjoyable.
4. Flag Functionality: Players can strategically flag cells they suspect contain mines, adding a layer of tactical thinking to the game.
5. Winning Condition: Clear instructions and visual cues indicate when a player successfully completes the game by uncovering all safe cells.
6. Losing Condition: Clear indications and animations highlight when a player triggers a mine, resulting in a game over scenario.
