<h1>Detail Explanation of Project :</h1>
<h6>This is a simple console typing speed test. You will be presented with a text, which you will have to type correctly as fast as you can. The timer will start after your first input and when you have finished typing the text, your typing speed will be calculated. The text will be color coded according to your input and there is also an extra blinker on top to notify you if you have typed anything wrong.</h6>
